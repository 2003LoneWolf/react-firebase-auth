## Introduction

This project showcases the implementation of Firebase Authentication within a React.js application. Firebase provides a comprehensive authentication system that includes email/password authentication, social login (Google, Facebook, etc.), and more. This integration allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their authentication state within the React app.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm (or yarn)
- Firebase account and a Firebase project set up

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/2003LoneWolf/react-firebase-auth.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd react-firebase-auth
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

## Configuration

To configure Firebase within the project:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. Obtain your Firebase configuration object (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.).
3. Replace the placeholder Firebase configuration in `firebase-config.js` with your actual Firebase configuration.

## Usage

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

This will start the React app at `http://localhost:3000`.
